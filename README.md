# dot files
different dot files for tools, mostly used by myself

## Bash
Works on my Mac, haven't tested on other OS and shell, but as long as you use bash shell, most of the stuff should function.
Some of the functions are copied from the internet, many thanks to those authors.

These dot files are tailored to meet my own needs, you are welcome to modify and help me to improve
